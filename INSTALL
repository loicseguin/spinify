Spinify 2.2

== System requirements ==

This software has been tested on Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu 9.10
(however see issue #8). It should work on almost any Unix or Linux
operating system.  For Windows, see below.

Spinify can produce files that allow to visualize the lattice and to
do some basic data visualization. In order
to use these files, you need to have Python (http://www.python.org/),
NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/) and matplotlib
(http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) installed.


== Installation ==

The most recent release version of Spinify is available here:
http://bitbucket.org/loicseguin/spinify/downloads/spinify-2.2.tar.gz.
You can install it by decompressing the archive

    $ tar xjvf spinify-2.2.tar.gz

and then build and install the program

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

That is it! You can start using Spinify right away. If you don't know
where to start, read the man page

    $ man 1 spinify

If you prefer not to use the Autotools, you can build with the provided
Makefile.unix. Just do

    $ make -f Makefile.unix
	$ make -f Makefile.unix install

Note that these files might be deprecated very soon. Use at your own
risks.


== Development version ==

If you want to try out the current development version of Spinify, you
first need to install Mercurial (http://mercurial.selenic.com/). Then,
just grab the source:

    $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/loicseguin/spinify/

You then need to build and install the software with

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

This will build all the classes and the main program. To build the
various tests, run

    $ make tests

These tests are quite rudimentary but can prove very useful for
debugging.


== Windows ==

Very little testing has been done on Windows OSes. The software may or
may not work correctly. If you want to try it out, the simplest is to
grab the executable directly from:

http://bitbucket.org/loicseguin/spinify/downloads/spinify-2.2.exe

This executable was built on Windows XP SP3. It runs fine on this
platform, but it has not been tested on Vista or Windows 7.

There is a Dev-C++ project file in src/win32 which can be used to build
the software on Windows (compiles with MinGW). The source does not
compile with MS Virtual C++.
