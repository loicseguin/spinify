Spinify is a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation for the 2D Ising model
of ferromagnetism on curved surfaces. It is written in C++ and
distributed under a BSD license (see LICENSE for more information).


== Install ==

This program has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu 9.10.
However, it should work on any Unix machine. To install run
    $ make
    $ make install
(the second command probably should be run as root). This will install
spinify and the man page. Note that man page installation fails on Ubuntu
because the directory /usr/local/share/man/man1 does not exist. Creating
this directory before running make install is the temporary fix for this
bug.

Note that in order to use the Python code output, you need to have
Python as well as matplotlib and NumPy.
