INSTALL

This program has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.6. However, it should
work on any Unix machine. To install run
    $ make
    $ make install
(the second command probably should be run as root). This will install
spinify, qdelaunay and related man pages.

Note that in order to use the Python code output, you need to have
Python as well as matplotlib and NumPy.
